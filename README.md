# Bienvenidxs Al Gran Casino

Gran Casino is a local rock band from Quilmes, Buenos Aires. It was my first freelance project. The client asked me to create a web page where the visitor can check new venues and news about the band.

# Stack
This project only uses CSS. The client`s demands require only that. I used CSS libraries like Font Awesome for the icons.
